#what is Linear Search?
#A linear search (or sequential search) is one of the simplest searching techniques. 
#It works by checking each element in a list sequentially until the target value is found or the list ends. 
#It does not require the data to be sorted and works on any data type.

#How it works:
#Start from the first element of the array.
#Compare the current element with the target value.
#If a match is found, return the index.
#If no match is found after checking all elements, return -1.
